## Hi there 👋 Welcome to my GitHub

I'm Daniel Quintanilla — a former pilot turned self-taught developer. Tech gave me the career path I didn’t find in aviation, and I’m now focused on Java, Spring Boot, and building clean, real-world backend apps. I'm actively looking for my first opportunity in tech and always open to feedback. Let’s connect!

- 🔭 I’m currently working on building backend projects using Java and Spring Boot
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Spring Boot, REST APIs, and backend best practices
- 📫 I’m looking to collaborate on beginner-friendly or intermediate Java / Spring Boot projects
